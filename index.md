## About Me

Hello! I am a senior research scientist at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html) , which I joined in 2021 after I graduated from the [University of Central Florida](http://www.ucf.edu/). My research  focuses on the areas of summarization, information extraction,  document understanding and generation. I have also worked on Computer Vision, specifically action recognition based on videos during his Ph.D. and am interested in multi-modal grounding across NLP and CV.
