## About Me

Hello! (ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî!) 

I am a senior research scientist at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html). My research  focuses on the areas of summarization, long document understanding, and understanding of LLMs. I am also interested in multi-modal Audio and Vision with Large Language models.

Are you a self-motivated student seeking an enriching internship experience? Please reach out to me via email to explore exciting internship opportunities throughout the year. Our internships not only offer valuable hands-on research experience but also provide opportunities for publishing papers.
