My name is Sangwoo Cho or 조상우 (in Korean) and I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Central Florida . My research interests include Computer Vision, Video Action Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Automatic Text Summarization, and Deep Learning. I am currently under the supervision of Dr. Hassan Foroosh in the CIL and Dr. Fei Liu in the UCF NLP group.\nMy current research focuses on two folds: human action recognition and extractive text summarization of news articles. More specifically, I am working on video and skeleton based human action recognition, which takes a video or key points of a human body and predicts human activities. It is important to extract spatial and temporal information carefully as videos contain both information. Another research topic I am working on is multi-document summarization, which seeks to take a cluster of multiple articles and create one summary. This requires special process to focus on the most important information, while avoiding redundancy that is common in multi-document clusters.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sangwoo3.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
